# Easy-Layouts-with-Flexbox
The Flexbox (or Flexible Box) Layout Model is a set of CSS attributes allowing for the efficient creation of robust, multi-screen application layouts. Flexbox uses a dual-axis container/item layout model allowing for powerful approaches to element space distribution, alignment, and sizing. This can be a tremendous boon for web projects with dynamic data and design flux. It may also tremendously simplify responsive layouts that are dependent on commonly complicated grid models.
